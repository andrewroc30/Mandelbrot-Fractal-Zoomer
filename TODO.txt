UI:
 - Have checkbox for using auto iterations, which clears iterations field if checked
 - Have checkbox for looping or not in GIF

GENERAL:
 - Be able to start creation from another folder of images that was partially created
 - Change up the algorithm to be smooth instead of normal (check wiki for pseudo)
 - Change coloring to use histogram coloring?? (could have better color scheme as well)
 - Maybe find some more points to zoom into (https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2181175/value-to-use-as-center-of-mandelbrot-set-zoom)
 - Option to use higher d (multibrot sets with higher exponents)
 - Create interactive zoomer (e.g. click on a point to zoom into)

SPEEDUPS:
 - Possibly automatically increase iterations as we zoom in further, making initial images lighter
   - Possibly try to see if percentage of points that are in same iteration is higher than the last image?  Pretty crude though...
 - Could try to memoize points maybe... (unlikely to work or be effective)
 - Many optimizations here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set
 - Utilize GPU

BUGS:
 - createSmoothZoomedImage doesn't work
