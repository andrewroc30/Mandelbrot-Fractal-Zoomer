UI:
 - PNG window
   - Have option to not show image resolving
     - If not showing, only then should we need iterations
 - GIF window
   - Have checkbox for looping or not
 - GIF/MP4 window
   - Show progress of running threads in window (percent of pixels calculated)
   - Make sure that we aren't creating images unnecessarily
      - Show last created image while creating images
      - Possibly show last image first to see if end goal is good
 - All windows
   - Correct window sizes for UI
   - Have a 'home' button that brings you back to the start window
   - Make starting window disappear after choosing
   - Make status label always be centered

GENERAL:
 - Put classes into packages to clean code(Particularly all the Window classes)
 - Increase precision of calculations to better than double
 - Be able to start creation from another folder of images that was partially created
 - Change up the algorithm to be smooth instead of normal (check wiki for pseudo)
 - Change coloring to use histogram coloring?? (could have better color scheme as well)
 - Option to use higher d (multibrot sets with higher exponents)
 - Create interactive zoomer (e.g. click on a point to zoom into)
 - Create window with slider that adjusts iterations on an image
   - Here, we should hold onto the values of each iteration (memoize)
   - Keep calculating iterations as much as possible, so that we can instantly slide
   - Update slider so that maximum is always the latest iteration calculation

SPEEDUPS:
 - Possibly automatically increase iterations as we zoom in further, making initial images lighter
   - Possibly try to see if percentage of points that are in same iteration is higher than the last image?  Pretty crude though...
 - Could try to memoize points maybe... (unlikely to work or be effective)
 - Many optimizations here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set
 - Utilize GPU

BUGS:
 - createSmoothZoomedImage doesn't work
