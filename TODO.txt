UI:
 - Have checkbox for using auto iterations, which clears iterations field if checked
 - Be able to specify file output path
 - Be able to specify maximum thread count
 - Have checkbox for looping or not in GIF
 - Have input validation

GENERAL:
 - Change up the algorithm to be smooth instead of normal (check wiki for pseudo)
 - Change coloring to use histogram coloring?? (could have better color scheme as well)
 - Option to use higher d (multibrot sets with higher exponents)
 - Be able to watch GIF or see image in window, not just save to file

SPEEDUPS:
 - Possibly automatically increase iterations as we zoom in further, making initial images lighter
   - Possibly try to see if percentage of points that are black is higher than the last image?  Pretty crude though...
 - Could try to memoize points maybe... (unlikely to work or be effective)
 - Many optimizations here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

BUGS:
 - createSmoothZoomedImage doesn't work
