 * Representation of methods of performing Euclidean division--dividing to an integer and obtaining

 * Given the division problem a/b, all methods produce integer quotient q and remainder r, with {@code 0 <= r < b},
 * fulfilling the equations:<br>
 * <br>
 * {@code a/b = q + r/b}<br>
 * {@code a = b*q + r}<br>
